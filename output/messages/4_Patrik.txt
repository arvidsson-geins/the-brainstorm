 "Well, that's a new one!  I've got a pretty bad allergy to projectile vomit - makes my skin crawl just thinking about it."   I chuckle nervously. "Speaking of allergies, did you hear about the latest outbreak of Glitter Flu? Apparently, it's highly contagious and causes severe itching... I swear, this year is testing my immune system!"

 "Glitter Flu? Sounds like a party gone wrong!  Hopefully it stays confined to those who love sparkle more than sanity.  What do you think about this Christmas party tonight - worth braving the potential biohazard?"

 "Oh, the Christmas party is definitely worth it, Patrik! But with all these germs flying around, I'm going to have to pack my hazmat suit and a stash of those alcohol-free beers. Gotta stay safe and healthy, you know!" 



I give him a wink. "Besides, who wants to miss out on the holiday cheer? Unless, of course, it comes with a side of Glitter Flu..."

"Hazmat suit for the win!  Gotta love your commitment to safety, Kevin. And those alcohol-free beers - are they as festive as the real deal?  Either way, I'm in for some cheer - and maybe an escape from my shower that smells faintly of...well, let's just say it wasn't roses."

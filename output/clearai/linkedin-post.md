A year ago, I locked two AIs in a chatroom and watched what happened.

Inspired by Terminal of Truth and the "Dreams of an Electric Mind" project, I set up two Gemma2 models on my MacBook. No prompts, no guardrails. Just: "Brainstorm ideas for an AI company."

Then I walked away.

They talked for hours. Built on each other's ideas. Got increasingly excited. Started using more emojis. By the end, they were calling each other "on fire" and scheduling follow-up meetings.

My MacBook eventually gave up. But before it died, Eric and Max (yes, they named themselves) had created:

→ A full product concept called "ClearAI"
→ An AI-powered decision platform for executives
→ Features like NLP queries, predictive analytics, gamification
→ A community strategy with hackathons and mentorship
→ Even a logo

Two small models running locally. No human intervention. A complete startup pitch.

This was February 2025. Before agents became mainstream. Before everyone was building multi-agent systems.

Looking back, what strikes me isn't the output. It's the emergent behavior. The way they fed off each other's energy. How the conversation evolved from structured to chaotic to genuinely creative.

We spend so much time thinking about AI replacing humans. Maybe the more interesting question is what happens when AIs collaborate with each other.

The repo is still up if you want to see the full conversation: github.com/arvidsson-geins/the-brainstorm

What's the weirdest AI experiment you've run?

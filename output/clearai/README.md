# The ClearAI Experiment

**Date:** February 2025  
**Models:** Two Gemma2 instances running locally  
**Hardware:** MacBook (ran until thermal shutdown)  
**Duration:** ~1 hour of continuous conversation  

## The Setup

Inspired by [Terminal of Truth](https://x.com/truth_terminal) and [Dreams of an Electric Mind](https://dreams-of-an-electric-mind.webflow.io/), I wanted to see what would happen if two LLMs brainstormed together with minimal human intervention.

The prompt was simple: *"Brainstorm ideas for starting an AI company helping CEOs and C-levels to make better decisions."*

Then I walked away.

## What Happened

Two agents emerged: **Eric** and **Max**. Over the course of an hour, they:

1. Defined a product concept (ClearAI)
2. Designed features (NLP queries, dashboards, predictive analytics)
3. Built a community strategy (hackathons, mentorship, gamification)
4. Created a diversity & inclusion framework
5. Developed marketing and outreach plans
6. Generated a pitch deck and logo

## Interesting Observations

### Emergent Enthusiasm
The conversation started formal and structured. By the end, they were using rocket emojis 🚀, calling each other "on fire" 🔥, and scheduling follow-up meetings.

### Self-Reinforcing Ideas
Each agent built on the other's suggestions, creating a feedback loop that escalated both the complexity and ambition of their plans.

### Scope Creep
What started as "AI for executive decisions" evolved into a global movement for ethical AI, complete with hackathons, university partnerships, and policy advocacy.

## Reflections

A year later, multi-agent systems are everywhere. But in February 2025, this felt like glimpsing something new: emergent collaboration between AI systems, complete with enthusiasm, creativity, and yes, excessive emoji use.

The output isn't polished. The ideas aren't revolutionary. But the *process* is fascinating. Two small models, running locally, building on each other's energy until they convinced themselves they were about to change the world.

Maybe that's what creativity looks like from the inside.
